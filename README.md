# 👋 Hi, I’m Anjali Rajput

I used to help build the systems that keep the digital world humming, like data centers, networks, and critical infrastructure. Now I’m trying to break them (ethically, of course) to figure out how to protect them.

Somewhere between chasing down cable faults and surviving server room temps that could cook rice, I realized what fascinated me most wasn’t how things run, but how they fail and how to keep bad actors from making them fail on purpose.

That curiosity led me into cybersecurity, and I haven’t looked back since (except occasionally to Google acronyms I probably should’ve memorized by now).
